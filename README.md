# SARS-COV-3-Detection_with_Deep_learning

## Context
It is 2030, and a new RNA virus named SARS-CoV-3 is wreaking havoc across the globe. Its death rate is estimated at 95%, making it one of the deadliest  respiratory viruses known to mankind. Fortunately, an Ottawa-based biotech company developed a nasally-delivered vaccine *Greenraza*™️ that can neutralize the virus in living patients. However, administrating the vaccine increases the risk of lung cancer by a whooping 60%. It is therefore vital that the drug be administered to infected patients only, not to patients infected with another respiratory virus such as the common cold or influenza. The virus cannot be detected through blood or breath analyses. It can only be detected by means of x-ray imaging.

Having heard of your newly developed expertise in deep learning, you have been tasked by the Ottawa Hospital with the design of a machine learning model capable of distinguishing patients infected with SARS-CoV-3 from patients that have pneumonia and non-infected patients. Healthy patients can be discharged, while patients with pneumonia must be isolated, but without being given *Greenraza*™️.
